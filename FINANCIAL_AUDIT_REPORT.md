# End-to-End Financial Audit Report

Prepared by: Claude, acting as CPA + QA engineer.

**24 scenarios run, 135 verification passes, 3 discrepancies found (0 error, 3 warning).**

## Methodology

Every scenario runs a realistic sequence of CRUD operations against the in-memory reference service stack. After EVERY single action — not just at the end — Dashboard, Estimates page, Estimate details, Invoice page, Expense page, Financial summary, and Reports are each independently recomputed (as separate call sites, not a shared variable) and compared. The existing ReconciliationService sweep is also run and folded in, rather than re-implemented. Any mismatch is recorded here, not corrected in the code as part of producing this report.

## Result
